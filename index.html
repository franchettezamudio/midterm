      <h3>Design</h3>

      <p><strong>Design</strong> is the creation of a plan or <a class="first_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)" target="_blank">convention</a> for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in <a class="second_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint" target="_blank">architectural blueprints</a>, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns).[1] Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be design.</p>
      <p>Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes, and even methods of designing.[2]</p>
      <p>Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation, as is made clear by grammatical context.</p>

      <h1>Definitions</h1>
      <h2>More formally design has been defined as follows.</h2>
      <p>(noun) a specification of an object, manifested by an agent, intended to accomplish goals, in a particular environment, using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of requirements, subject to constraints;
      (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an environment (where the designer operates)[3]
      Another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective.[4]...</p>
      <h2>Design as a process</h2>
      <p>Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Dorst and Dijkhuis argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",[9] both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "The Rational Model",[10] "Technical Problem Solving"[11] and "The Reason-Centric Perspective".[12] The alternative view has been called "Reflection-in-Action",[11] "Evolutionary Design",[8] "co-evolution",[13] and "The Action-Centric Perspective".[12]</p>
